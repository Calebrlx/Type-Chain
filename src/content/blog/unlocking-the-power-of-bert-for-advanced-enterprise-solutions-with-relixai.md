description: "BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a natural language processing model developed by Google. It's a pre-trained model that's been trained on a large corpus of text, allowing it to understand the context and meaning of words in a sentence. BERT revolutionized the field by introducing bidirectional context, capturing relationships between words more effectively than previous models. This has led to significant improvements in various NLP tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, and language translation."
